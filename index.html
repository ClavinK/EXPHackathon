            <br> Visitors of the website will also be able to create a To-Do task list with an emphasis on the Eisenhower Matrix 
            <br>by categorizing them based on urgency and importance. Users will find use in the Pomodoro Techinque 
            <br>when beginning focus on extended study sessions.
